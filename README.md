# To-Do List App - TaskMaster

This project aims to create a simple yet functional To-Do List application. Users will be able to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The application will provide a clear and intuitive user interface for managing their daily tasks, helping them stay organized and productive. The app will support persistent storage of tasks, ensuring data is not lost when the application is closed and reopened.

**Tech Stack**: Frontend: React (for a dynamic and component-based UI), or HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for a simpler approach).
   Backend (if needed for more complex features like user accounts or syncing): Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django, or Go.
   Database (if needed for backend): MongoDB (for a NoSQL approach), PostgreSQL (for a relational database), or a simpler solution like localStorage (for a client-side only app).
   State Management (if needed): Redux, Zustand, or Context API (React).
   Version Control: Git
